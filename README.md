# PowerShtik
Shtik integration for PowerPoint

## TODO

Brief scout around the Office SDK for PowerPoint suggests the following things are possible:

- Hook an event when the Slide changes
  - Question: does this event trigger for slides that reveal step-by-step?
- Export a slide as a PNG image, which can be uploaded to Shtik.io in realtime
- Grab notes and things from the presentation
